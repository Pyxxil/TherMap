# TherMap

TherMap is a webapp that allows users to enter their destination, and then through the use of "hot" and "cold" sound cues, directs them to their final destination. There is no map, only a tree that can either burn or freeze depend on how far the user is to their location. Once a user is about to reach their destination, the app will route them to a point of interest, making them procastination. 

This project was built over the weekend of 31 July - 2 August, as part of the 2021 WDCC x SESA Hackathon. It uses the Google Maps API to get the coordinates of the destination, and then calculates the Euclidean distance between where the user is and the destination. 

## Motivation

The theme for the 2021 WDCC x SESA Hackathon was "Facilitating Procastination". As a team, we decided to build a webapp that would take people to their destinations, but route them to a point of interest that is close to them. 

## Results:
Our team came third! Here's a photo of the team:
